FARKLE is a push-your-luck game in which the objective is to be the first player to accumulate 10.000 points. The play is passed back and forth as players attempt to gather point-scoring melds while evaluating if the risk of rolling a farkle and losing all unbanked points is worth the lure of getting just a few more points. As with many games Farkle is played in numerous regions with dozens of variations. The version we have here is among the simpler ones, and only includes the standard melds common to most variations we could find.
# Gmae Play #
**Rolling, scoring, banking**
  - The game is played with six dice. A player starts their turn by throwing all six dice. Once the dice have been rolled the player may put aside any dice that form scoring melds (see melds below). A player must put aside at least one scoring dice each throw, but beyond that is free in what dice they put aside or throw again.
  - Players may now roll any remaining dice not already put aside in hopes of being able to make more melds, risking the chance of farkling (see below) and scoring nothing. Players who decide not to take that risk can instead bank. When a player banks any points earned during the round are added to the grand total and are safe for the rest of the game. The player's turn ends and they pass all dice to their opponent who takes their turn.

FARKLE is a push-your-luck game in which the objective is to be the first player to accumulate 10.000 points. The play is passed back and forth as players attempt to gather point-scoring melds while evaluating if the risk of rolling a farkle and losing all unbanked points is worth the lure of getting just a few more points. As with many games Farkle is played in numerous regions with dozens of variations. The version we have here is among the simpler ones, and only includes the standard melds common to most variations we could find.

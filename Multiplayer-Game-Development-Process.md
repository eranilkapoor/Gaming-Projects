Designing the backend for a multiplayer mobile game requires the integration of several services to handle different tasks like user management, real-time gameplay, analytics, etc. AWS provides a range of services that can be utilised for this purpose. Since you're using Unity to develop the front-end, I'll provide a general architecture design that involves both AWS services and Unity. 

**Frontend Architecture:**

The frontend of the game is where the user interacts with the game, usually via a GUI. The design can be divided into the following components:

1. **User Interface (UI)**: Unity provides a robust UI system for creating interactive interfaces. This includes menus, HUDs, buttons, input fields, sliders, etc.

2. **Game Engine**: Unity is the game engine, responsible for rendering graphics, playing sounds, and handling physics calculations, among other things.

3. **Gameplay Logic**: This includes the rules of the game and how various game objects interact with each other. In a dice game like Yatzy or Farkle, this would include the dice mechanics, scoring system, turn management, etc.

4. **AWS SDK**: The AWS SDK for Unity allows you to interact with AWS services. This can be used for authentication, database interaction, and more.

**Backend Architecture:**

The backend of the game handles data management, multiplayer functionality, security, and other services that should not be client-dependent. For this architecture, we can use several AWS services:

1. **Amazon Cognito** for user identity and data synchronisation. This service handles user registration, authentication, and account recovery.

2. **AWS AppSync** or **API Gateway** for managing secure API calls from the client.

3. **AWS Lambda** to handle serverless computing tasks. These are functions that can be executed based on certain triggers, like user actions or database updates.

4. **Amazon DynamoDB** for storing game data. This could include user profiles, game state, leaderboard data, etc. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service that is efficient and scales well.

5. **Amazon GameLift** for managing game sessions and matchmaking. It provides solutions for multiplayer games, including matchmaking and scaling game server fleets.

6. **Amazon S3** for storage of larger static files like game assets, logs, etc.

7. **Amazon CloudWatch** for monitoring your application and AWS resources used by it.

8. **Amazon Kinesis** to collect, process, and analyse real-time, streaming data to get timely insights and react quickly to new information.

**Data Flow:**

Here is a high-level overview of how data might flow in this architecture:

1. User interacts with the game through the Unity GUI.

2. Unity communicates with AWS through the SDK. This could be a Cognito request for user authentication, a Lambda function to process a game action, an AppSync call to update the game state, etc.

3. DynamoDB stores and retrieves data as needed. This could be user profiles, game state, or leaderboard data.

4. GameLift handles the multiplayer aspect, creating and managing game sessions as needed.

5. S3 can be used to store and retrieve larger static files.

6. AWS CloudWatch is used to monitor and troubleshoot your AWS resources and applications. 

7. Amazon Kinesis can be used to collect and analyse real-time player data, providing insights to improve the game.

Remember, this is a high-level overview and your specific needs may require modifications to this architecture. Game development is a complex process that involves careful planning, testing, and iteration. Each service mentioned above requires in-depth understanding and proper implementation to ensure security and efficiency. 

This architecture should provide a solid foundation to build upon. However, it's recommended to consult with a solutions architect or a similar

Lambda functions can be used to handle many different aspects of a multiplayer game. For a dice game, you might have Lambda functions for:

- Handling a player's turn: When a player takes their turn, you could have a Lambda function that validates the move, calculates any resulting changes (e.g., score updates), and updates the game state in DynamoDB.
- Handling matchmaking: When players want to start a new game, a Lambda function could handle the matchmaking process, adding them to an appropriate game session.
- Processing end-of-game results: When a game ends, a Lambda function could update player statistics, process any rewards, and update leaderboards.

When it comes to throttling, AWS Lambda has a couple of built-in features:

1. **Concurrency limits**: As of my last training cut-off in September 2021, by default, AWS sets a soft limit of 1000 concurrent executions per region, which can be increased if necessary by contacting AWS support. If more requests come in than your limit, the excess requests will be throttled. In your game, if you expect to have more than 1000 concurrent users, you may need to request an increase to your limit.

2. **Burst concurrency**: AWS also provides a "burst pool" of 500 to 3000 concurrent executions (depending on the region), which can be used for short periods of high demand. 

3. **Reserved concurrency**: If you have critical functions that must always be able to execute, you can set a reserved concurrency limit for them. This ensures that a certain number of executions are always available for these functions.

In your case, you need to estimate the number of Lambda invocations that will happen per unit of time. This will depend on game mechanics (how often players can or will take actions), number of concurrent users, and how you've divided tasks between Lambda functions.

Remember to carefully monitor and adjust your settings as needed. AWS provides tools like CloudWatch for monitoring Lambda functions, and you can set alarms to notify you if you're nearing your concurrency limit. 

In terms of pricing, you're billed for each request and the time your code executes in increments of 1ms. The free tier includes 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month. Beyond that, the cost as of my last training cut-off was $0.20 per 1M requests and $0.0000166667 for every GB-second.

One last note: Be careful when designing your Lambda functions. Make sure to manage exceptions and errors correctly, and ensure functions finish execution as soon as the work is done. Long-running functions could tie up your concurrent execution limit and increase costs.

The type and number of EC2 instances you'll need to handle your user load will depend on several factors:

1. **Game Complexity**: A simple game like a dice game will require much less computing power than a complex 3D multiplayer game.

2. **Data Transfer**: How much data is being sent between the server and clients? More data means more bandwidth and potentially more powerful servers.

3. **Other Server Functions**: Are your servers just handling matchmaking and game state, or are they also running AI, physics, and other game mechanics?

Given that you're making a relatively simple dice game, you won't need particularly powerful servers. A small to medium EC2 instance should be able to handle the server-side processing for many concurrent games.

AWS provides a wide variety of instance types optimised to fit different use cases. For example, compute-optimised instances (C series) might be a good fit if your game is CPU-intensive, while memory-optimised instances (R series) could be better if your game requires a lot of memory. Since your game is a dice game, it probably doesn't require much of either, so you might be fine with general purpose instances (T and M series).

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, a medium-sized general purpose instance (t3.medium) costs around $0.0416 per hour for instances running Linux, and a larger instance (m5.large) costs around $0.096 per hour. These costs can be significantly reduced if you reserve instances for a long period (1 to 3 years), or if you use Spot Instances, which let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud.

For 100 concurrent users, it's likely that a single t3.medium instance could handle the load, given the simplicity of a dice game. However, you should perform load testing to determine the actual capabilities of your setup.

As your game scales up to 1000 concurrent users, you might need to scale up your resources as well. If a single t3.medium instance can handle 100 users, you might need around 10 of them for 1000 users. Again, actual results will depend on load testing.

Keep in mind, the actual cost will also depend on other factors, such as data transfer costs, storage costs, and costs associated with other AWS services you're using.

Finally, remember that AWS also provides an Auto Scaling feature, which can automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to traffic patterns. This can help you handle spikes in traffic without manually provisioning additional servers.
Dynamo DB Schema


Designing a DynamoDB data schema requires careful planning to ensure that your application can efficiently access and update data. For a multiplayer dice game like Yatzy, here are some tables you might consider:

1. **Users Table**

- **UserId** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user
- **Username**: User's chosen name
- **Email**: User's email address
- **PasswordHash**: Hashed version of the user's password (never store passwords in plain text)
- **CreationDate**: When the user account was created
- **LastLoginDate**: Last time the user logged in

2. **Games Table**

- **GameId** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each game
- **GameStartTime**: When the game started
- **GameEndTime**: When the game ended
- **GameStatus**: Current status of the game (e.g., active, ended)
- **WinnerId**: UserId of the game's winner
- **GameScores**: Map of UserIds to their final scores in the game

3. **GamePlayers Table**

- **GameId** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each game
- **UserId** (Sort Key): Unique identifier for each user
- **UserGameStatus**: Status of the user in the game (e.g., active, forfeited)
- **UserGameScore**: User's current score in the game

4. **PlayerScores Table**

- **UserId** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user
- **GameId** (Sort Key): Unique identifier for each game
- **Score**: Score the user achieved in the game
- **Timestamp**: When the score was recorded

5. **UserFriends Table**

- **UserId** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user
- **FriendId** (Sort Key): Unique identifier for each friend

Remember that DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, so it doesn't require a fixed schema for all items in a table. For example, in the Games Table, the WinnerId attribute could be absent for games that haven't finished yet.

DynamoDB supports complex data types like lists and maps, which can be useful for storing multiple values in a single attribute. For example, the GameScores attribute in the Games Table could be a map where each key is a UserId and each value is that user's final score.

When designing your DynamoDB tables, think about the queries you'll need to perform and try to minimise the amount of data you'll need to read to satisfy each query. Use secondary indexes to enable efficient querying on non-key attributes.

Also, remember that DynamoDB charges based on the amount of data you read or write, so efficient design can also help control costs.

For analytics, consider integrating with AWS Kinesis or AWS QuickSight to gather and visualise your data.

DB Schema: Detailed.


Certainly! You can design your database schema to capture as much detail as you need. For an extensive data capture, consider the following additions and adjustments to your DynamoDB tables:

1. **UserDetails Table**

- **UserId** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user.
- **UserName**: User's chosen name.
- **Email**: User's email address.
- **PasswordHash**: Hashed version of the user's password (never store passwords in plain text).
- **CreationDate**: When the user account was created.
- **LastLoginDate**: Last time the user logged in.
- **TotalGamesPlayed**: The total number of games played by the user.
- **TotalWins**: The total number of games won by the user.
- **TotalLosses**: The total number of games lost by the user.
- **HighestScore**: The highest score achieved by the user.

2. **Games Table**

- **GameId** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each game.
- **GameStartTime**: When the game started.
- **GameEndTime**: When the game ended.
- **GameStatus**: Current status of the game (e.g., active, ended).
- **PlayerList**: List of UserIds of the players in the game.
- **WinnerId**: UserId of the game's winner.
- **GameScores**: Map of UserIds to their final scores in the game.
- **Turns**: List of objects representing each turn in the game. Each object could contain details like the UserId of the player who took the turn, the dice roll result, the time of the turn, etc.

3. **PlayerActions Table**

- **ActionId** (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each action.
- **GameId**: The identifier of the game in which the action took place.
- **UserId**: The identifier of the user who performed the action.
- **ActionType**: The type of action (e.g., "roll dice", "score", "forfeit").
- **ActionTimestamp**: When the action was performed.
- **ActionResult**: The result of the action (e.g., dice roll result).
- **ActionDetails**: Any other details relevant to the action.

4. **UserFriends Table**

- **UserId** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user.
- **FriendId** (Sort Key): Unique identifier for each friend.
- **FriendSince**: When the user and friend became friends.

These adjustments will allow you to capture very detailed information about games and user actions. Keep in mind that more detailed data capture will increase the complexity of your database and could potentially increase costs, so it's important to make sure that you're only capturing data that will be useful for your application.

Designing the backend for a multiplayer mobile game requires the integration of several services to handle different tasks like user management, real-time gameplay, analytics, etc. AWS provides a range of services that can be utilised for this purpose. Since you're using Unity to develop the front-end, I'll provide a general architecture design that involves both AWS services and Unity. 

**Frontend Architecture:**

The frontend of the game is where the user interacts with the game, usually via a GUI. The design can be divided into the following components:

1. **User Interface (UI)**: Unity provides a robust UI system for creating interactive interfaces. This includes menus, HUDs, buttons, input fields, sliders, etc.

2. **Game Engine**: Unity is the game engine, responsible for rendering graphics, playing sounds, and handling physics calculations, among other things.

3. **Gameplay Logic**: This includes the rules of the game and how various game objects interact with each other. In a dice game like Yatzy or Farkle, this would include the dice mechanics, scoring system, turn management, etc.

4. **AWS SDK**: The AWS SDK for Unity allows you to interact with AWS services. This can be used for authentication, database interaction, and more.

**Backend Architecture:**

The backend of the game handles data management, multiplayer functionality, security, and other services that should not be client-dependent. For this architecture, we can use several AWS services:

1. **Amazon Cognito** for user identity and data synchronisation. This service handles user registration, authentication, and account recovery.

2. **AWS AppSync** or **API Gateway** for managing secure API calls from the client.

3. **AWS Lambda** to handle serverless computing tasks. These are functions that can be executed based on certain triggers, like user actions or database updates.

4. **Amazon DynamoDB** for storing game data. This could include user profiles, game state, leaderboard data, etc. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service that is efficient and scales well.

5. **Amazon GameLift** for managing game sessions and matchmaking. It provides solutions for multiplayer games, including matchmaking and scaling game server fleets.

6. **Amazon S3** for storage of larger static files like game assets, logs, etc.

7. **Amazon CloudWatch** for monitoring your application and AWS resources used by it.

8. **Amazon Kinesis** to collect, process, and analyse real-time, streaming data to get timely insights and react quickly to new information.

**Data Flow:**

Here is a high-level overview of how data might flow in this architecture:

1. User interacts with the game through the Unity GUI.

2. Unity communicates with AWS through the SDK. This could be a Cognito request for user authentication, a Lambda function to process a game action, an AppSync call to update the game state, etc.

3. DynamoDB stores and retrieves data as needed. This could be user profiles, game state, or leaderboard data.

4. GameLift handles the multiplayer aspect, creating and managing game sessions as needed.

5. S3 can be used to store and retrieve larger static files.

6. AWS CloudWatch is used to monitor and troubleshoot your AWS resources and applications. 

7. Amazon Kinesis can be used to collect and analyse real-time player data, providing insights to improve the game.

Remember, this is a high-level overview and your specific needs may require modifications to this architecture. Game development is a complex process that involves careful planning, testing, and iteration. Each service mentioned above requires in-depth understanding and proper implementation to ensure security and efficiency. 

This architecture should provide a solid foundation to build upon. However, it's recommended to consult with a solutions architect or a similar
